This Verilog module, named top, is a state machine designed to control a traffic light system. It has four inputs: clk (the clock signal), reset (the reset signal), pedestrian_button (a signal indicating whether the pedestrian crossing button has been pressed), and car_sensor (a signal indicating whether a car is detected). The output is a 3-bit signal, lights, which represents the state of the traffic lights.
The module uses four states represented by 2-bit signals: WAIT, GO, WARN, and STOP. The state machine starts in the WAIT state. It also has a counter, count, which is used to time the duration of certain states.
The lights signal uses 3 bits to represent RED, YELLOW, and GREEN lights.
The state machine works as follows:
In the WAIT state, if a car is detected (car_sensor is high), the lights turn RED and the state transitions to GO. If no car is detected, the lights turn YELLOW and the state transitions to WARN.
In the GO state, if the counter is less than 6, the lights turn GREEN and the state remains GO. If the counter is 6 or more, the lights turn YELLOW and the state transitions to WARN.
In the WARN state, if the counter is less than 2, the lights remain YELLOW and the state remains WARN. If the counter is 2 or more and the pedestrian button has been pressed, the lights turn RED and the state transitions to STOP. If the counter is 2 or more and the pedestrian button has not been pressed, the lights turn RED and the state transitions to GO.
In the STOP state, if the counter is less than 4, the lights remain RED and the state remains STOP. If the counter is 4 or more, the lights turn GREEN and the state transitions to GO.
The reset input asynchronously resets the state to WAIT and the counter to 0.
The counter increments by 1 at every positive edge of the clock, unless it reaches 10, at which point it resets to 0. This mechanism is used to time the duration of the traffic light states.
