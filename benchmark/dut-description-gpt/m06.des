This Verilog code describes a module named "top" that implements a prioritized request handling mechanism. The module receives four input requests and one clock signal, and outputs one grant signal. The grant signal is a 4-bit vector where each bit represents if a specific request is granted or not.
The module uses a finite state machine (FSM) with three states: INIT, ANALISI_REQ, and ASSEGNA. The FSM transitions between states on the positive edge of the clock signal.
Here's a summary of the logic:
INIT: In this state, the module initializes the request variables (ru1 to ru4) with the current request inputs (REQUEST1 to REQUEST4). Then it moves to the ANALISI_REQ state.
ANALISI_REQ: In this state, the module first assigns the current grant value to the output GRANT_O. Then, it checks each request variable (ru1 to ru4). If a request is active and wasn't active in the last cycle (checked by the fu* variables), it adds the request to a queue (coda0 to coda3). The queue is implemented as a shift register, where a new request pushes older requests down the queue. The request identifiers (U1 to U4) are used to specify which request is in the queue. After processing all requests, the module stores the current requests in the fu* variables for use in the next cycle, and transitions to the ASSEGNA state.
ASSEGNA: In this state, if any request was active in the previous cycle, the module grants the request at the front of the queue (stored in coda0). The grant variable is set to a 4-bit value where each bit corresponds to a specific request. After granting a request, the queue is shifted, removing the granted request from the front. The module then updates the request variables (ru1 to ru4) with the current request inputs, and transitions back to the ANALISI_REQ state.
This module seems to implement a kind of round-robin scheduling algorithm with a priority mechanism. If multiple requests are active at the same time, they are added to the queue in the order they are checked (REQUEST1 to REQUEST4). Then, in the ASSEGNA state, the request at the front of the queue is granted. The module continues granting requests and adding new ones to the queue as long as there are active requests.
