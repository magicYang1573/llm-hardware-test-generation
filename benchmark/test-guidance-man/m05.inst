First, you should reset the design to make count zero.
The count increment 1 when enable==1 and updown==1;
The count decrease 1 when enable==1 and updown==0;
To trigger the underflow, keep updown==0 and enable==1 when count is zero. 
To trigger the overflow, keep updown==1 and enable==1 when count is 15. This means you should make counter increment for 16 times.
