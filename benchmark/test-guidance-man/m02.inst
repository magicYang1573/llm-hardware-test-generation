First you should reset the DUT, and your design in in initial stage A.
To transition to state B, wait a clock cycle while in state S0.
To transition to state C, set LINEA==0 while in state B.
To transition to state D, you should first go to state C then set LINEA==0 when in state C.
To transition to state E, you should first go to state D, then next clock cycle you are in state E.
To transition to state F, you can first go to state B, then set LINEA==0 when in state B. 
To transition to state G, you should first go to state F, then next clock cycle you are in state G.
Remember, in each state, identify any uncovered lines and select the appropriate input to cover them.
